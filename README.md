### Setup
#### Node.js
1. Install the latest version of npm: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

#### Dafny
This application requires .NET SDK 6.0 and Dafny in order to run. We recommend using the provided script `./src/dafnySetup.sh` to automatically install required components; however, these are the steps to manually do so:
1. Install .NET SDK 6.0: `sudo apt install dotnet-sdk-6.0`
2. Install Dafny into the "src/dafny" directory:
    - `cd ./src`
    - `wget https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/releases/download/v4.4.0/dafny-4.4.0-x64-ubuntu-20.04.zip`
    - `unzip dafny-4.4.0-x64-ubuntu-20.04.zip`
3. Create the required file "src/Dafny-Files/dafnyCode.dfy":
    - `mkdir ./src/Dafny-Files`
    - `touch ./src/Dafny-Files/dafnyCode.dfy`

### Running
1. Run the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Run the frontend dev server: 
    - `cd /path/to/PSoft-Tools/psoft-tools`
    - `npm run dev`
